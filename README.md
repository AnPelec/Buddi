# Buddi Startup Company

#### During the freshman year of my undergraduate studies at MIT, I interned in Buddi, a startup company.

Our work was divided in two areas: **Machine Learning** and **Web Development**

For **Machine Learning**, our supervisor was giving us guidelines towards many useful resources. As a result, I had the opportunity to learn many things about *Neural Networks, Markov Chains and Support Vector Machines* among others. I also had the opportunity to experiment with *Tensorflow* and *Keras* with classifying information in images.

For **Web Development**, we had many smaller projects. We experimented with *ReactJS* and implemented a library for presenting data in *JavaScript*, using *PaperJS*.
